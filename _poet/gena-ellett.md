  <h2>The Stone</h2>
  <p>
    The stone is something your mother<br>
    gave you when you were six years old.<br>
    She left it somewhere—on the sill<br>
    of an open window or on the edge of a bath<br>
    she forgot to drain—and you picked it up.
  </p>
  <p>
    The stone was small and grey. When you held it<br>
    under water, it turned a shiny black, and<br>
    when you left it in the sun it looked like any piece<br>
    of gravel, but you knew that it was yours.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you first held it,<br>
    it had three sharp points that pressed<br>
    into your palm. Now when you open<br>
    your hand there are shadows cut across it,<br>
    dissected and crumpled, your life<br>
    lines shaped by the stone.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the years the edges have softened<br>
    or perhaps you’ve grown callous<br>
    or grown accustomed to it.<br>
    You could have let it go a long time ago but you didn’t.
  </p>
  <p>
    You protect the stone. When you’re careless,<br>
    others notice it in your palm.<br>
    Whenever you loosen your grasp<br>
    it shows through the cracks in your fingers.<br>
    They ask about it, you tighten<br>
    your grip until it’s suffocated<br>
    in your hand and you can barely feel it.<br>
    It has become a part of you and you know
  </p>
  <p>
    it’s made of you or you’re made of it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other people have<br>
    stones of their own, but you don’t ask,<br>
    you fear you will<br>
    have to defend your stone.<br>
    You can’t bare to tell them<br>
    how long you’ve had it or<br>
    how little you know about it.
  </p>
  <p>
    You feel the stone other places, too:
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s a sharp ache in the middle<br>
    of your back that you mistake for organ failure.<br>
    It’s a day in bed, asleep.<br>
    It’s a night in bed, awake.<br>
    It’s a snakebite on your ankle, a slow<br>
    cold spread of paralysis and shortening<br>
    of breath that comes on around midnight.<br>
    Lately, your fingers have been going<br>
    numb.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first time you tried to tell someone about it,<br>
    a bee got stuck in your throat and<br>
    stung at your words until you were hunched<br>
    and hiding—oh yes, the stone can<br>
    grow and the shadow of it<br>
    can turn into five hours in a bathtub, fingers<br>
    and toes wrinkled, and still your bones<br>
    clatter and you underwater-scramble<br>
    for the stone.
  </p>
  <p>
    You form a stone club. Membership is free<br>
    but it’s taken everything you’ve got. You sit<br>
    with the other members and rattle your stones. You practice<br>
    throwing them across the floor.<br>
    You meet at the beach<br>
    and you skip them across the water.<br>
    For scalding minutes<br>
    you revel in your lightness.
  </p>
  <p>
    Those without<br>
    stones must live in the clouds.
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s wonderful—the strength<br>
    and hindrance<br>
    of your grip.
  </p>
