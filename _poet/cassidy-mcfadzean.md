  <h2>Bellows</h2>
  <p>
    How breath enters<br>
    the body spellbinds.<br>
    I am half flesh and<br>
    half air, a fireplace<br>
    bellows, or empty<br>
    bag of rigid boards<br>
    pressed to channel<br>
    a stream of air.<br>
    Breath stoked our<br>
    Victorian fireplace<br>
    as atoms ricocheted<br>
    inside me, tending<br>
    a flame my lungs<br>
    fed when I breathed.<br>
    I dreamed last night<br>
    I was kicked out<br>
    of an oxygen bar,<br>
    tubes of plastic<br>
    attached to friends’<br>
    nostrils, inhaling<br>
    a beaker of blue<br>
    atop the counter.<br>
    We want to appear<br>
    lighter than we are.<br>
    Light as a feather,<br>
    stiff as a scar.

  <h2>Lullaby</h2>
  <p>
    I could not sleep for turning,<br>
    against the noises of the night.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I had a room to work in,<br>
    I was glad and I could write.
  </p>
  <p>
    But when I placed my head down,<br>
    my senses whirred as thoughts unsettled.
  </p>
  <p>
    Veering brought me to my limit.<br>
    No, I could not sleep for turning.
  </p>
  <p>
    I could not rest for dreaming,<br>
    when crossing over, I finally dozed.
  </p>
  <p>
    My dreams gave me a tower,<br>
    major arcana loomed above.
  </p>
  <p>
    Water crashed against the cliffside.<br>
    Coarseness grating on the smooth:
  </p>
  <p>
    I saw carpet fibers caught in flames.<br>
    No, I could not sleep for turning.
  </p>
  <p>
    I could not wake for feeling<br>
    all this world is one stray thought.
  </p>
  <p>
    That veering atoms, given time,<br>
    form an insect’s mandible,
  </p>
  <p>
    or as sugar spun to cotton,<br>
    or as a tree fused to a car.
  </p>
  <p>
    Or as language joined to babble.<br>
    No, I could not sleep for turning.
  </p>
