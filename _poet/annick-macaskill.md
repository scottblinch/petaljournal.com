<div class="poem">
  <h2>Hymn</h2>
  <p>
    Your pale hands against the background<br>
    of your bedroom, their existence outlined<br>
    and guaranteed. Always wary<br>
    of the silence around you, the house’s cold<br>
    stupor. It was winter, eventually.
  </p>
  <p>
    Are you living yet? Do birdcalls hold<br>
    anything like weeping or are they<br>
    still annoyance? Books ordered<br>
    along the windowpane, where their backs grew damp<br>
    with waiting. Your sister was next door,<br>
    pretending to sleep.
  </p>
  <p>
    History says nothing about this.<br>
    The days are long. They were longer,<br>
    then. Now you move the furniture.<br>
    You pay the rent.
  </p>
