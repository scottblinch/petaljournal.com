<div class="poem">
  <h2>blue preservation pill</h2>
  <p>
    Her place is forty-seven steps from the jukebox<br>
    and there’s an older blonde-grey version of yourself<br>
    sniping glances then declaring you shouldn’t have<br>
    done this to her while you bring the girl blue freezies<br>
    and coconut water for her hangover.<br>
    She dotted your letters, gauged pheromones correctly<br>
    always stroked your eye-lash curls, thinking bout’<br>
    her detective novel.<br>
    She’s had a scientific man<br>
    who taught her that the word doesn’t start with an F<br>
    and these mistakes perspire between<br>
    your timed breaths<br>
    and you’re running off blue preservation pills which<br>
    came from your ex who you used to fuck in the park.<br>
    There are two types of people. He claims her body was<br>
    made of eye-darts and timed metaphors and some<br>
    stayed to watch while others fled, in disgust, and<br>
    baby’s killing june-bugs with the anger of a fighting-man<br>
    ironing creases out of your fifteen-dollar shirt<br>
    with taupe lines from the seventies.<br>
    She plays a song bout’ someone who’s dead<br>
    frozen, in a state of hometown value ‘till she’s<br>
    driven into a silk mystery and doesn’t retain<br>
    eye contact with your friends. A nice girl, not all there.<br>
    you leave,<br>
    sparkling like a madman, jiving down your street<br>
    waving to the girls you know in bars<br>
    but she’s the one you’re out for, clearing her long<br>
    hairs from your chest and dreaming whispers into your<br>
    ears and nose and she’s always telling you<br>
    your pheromones are lovely.
