<div class="poem">
  <h2>of a man who fixes pools</h2>
  <p>
    of a man who fixes pools and sells <i>melcocha</i><br>
    on the beach, of a man who rides his bike up and down hills<br>
    to bring boiled fabric diapers to the hospital,<br>
    who counted cash under the mattress in the dark while you<br>
    put the baby to sleep, of a man who built a bunk bed out of ladders<br>
    and scrap paper and who still says heâ€™s sorry<br>
    for letting the tires of the motorcycle skid that afternoon,<br>
    of a man who fixes pools after all the food is<br>
    gone you can only say he must love his<br>
    wife and daughter enough<br>
    to swim through fire and<br>
    keep coming<br>
    home.
  </p>
