  <h2>Flyin’ Country</h2>
  <p>
    Didn’t want to come to this hole,<br>
    but did want to see you again,<br>
    in boots, happy.
  </p>
  <p>
    This long, long weekend goes<br>
    slow when it’s just you and I<br>
    and thirty thousand plaid backs
  </p>
  <p>
    bobbin’ and stompin’, singing,<br>
    stewing the grass into mud<br>
    kicked up our faded blue calves.
  </p>
  <p>
    Guitars drift along drumbeats<br>
    over our heads, dragging the first lyrics<br>
    you sent me, before it all happened
  </p>
  <p>
    as it happened.<br>
    We’re exposed in slivers<br>
    in the crowd, as Blake Shelton’s
  </p>
  <p>
    trollin’ for souls. Tebey’s trollin’<br>
    for Toby, Ruttan, Rhett and whisky.<br>
    Whitney Rose, Autumn Hill,
  </p>
  <p>
    Underwood, Hicks, Kicks and<br>
    Brooks, Farr gone along Emerson<br>
    Drive. Johnny Cash walks the Florida-
  </p>
  <p>
    Georgia Line, Smith’s in Dallas,<br>
    Stellas, and Kira Isabella. Kacey,<br>
    Mackenzie, Paul, and Porter.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pretty Girl, I say, take me to church<br>
    and let me see you shake it for Jason<br>
    Aldean, Flatts, Ford, Bentley and Lambert,
  </p>
  <p>
    Luke Bryan, Lee Brice, Brett, Blaine, Brant,<br>
    Bradley, and Bradbury, while Bamford<br>
    begs for One More Girl to end them all.
  </p>
  <p>
    You wanted Sam Hunt, but Hunter<br>
    Hayes takes rain in the form of ice<br>
    in the eye, and I’m so grateful
  </p>
  <p>
    it sends us to our tent<br>
    to pocket out the storm,<br>
    side by side in sleeping bags.
  </p>
  <p>
    We play crib without the baby<br>
    and our hearts break as they<br>
    mend. Here comes the sun,
  </p>
  <p>
    scorched again, shoulder to shoulder<br>
    we listen to our lives hummed out<br>
    on stage, and you won’t go on
  </p>
  <p>
    the Ferris Wheel, I assume,<br>
    because it’s too romantic<br>
    and we’re just friends now.
  </p>
  <p>
    Still look at us! Willing to do<br>
    the real love that comes after<br>
    we’ve let each other go.
  </p>
  <p>
    This work is deliberate.<br>
    No travesty of chance<br>
    has laid us out.
  </p>
