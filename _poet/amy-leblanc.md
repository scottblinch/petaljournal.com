<div class="poem">
  <h2>Tremor</h2>
  <p>
    My legs tremor ravens in my toes<br>
    off the side of the bed<br>
    wet envelopes, the waves in shakes<br>
    she pulls socks<br>
    on my feet<br>
    with four year<br>
    old saliva.
  </p>
  <p>
    I understand I’m not wearing any underwear<br>
    and that<br>
    the greatest disease on this earth wanted to be an artist<br>
    and that<br>
    there are days when I miss therapy.
  </p>
  <p>
    I try to say the radio<br>
    was hidden<br>
    in the rabbit hutch<br>
    twenty times fast before<br>
    the newscast about coffee beans<br>
    ends, but my tongue<br>
    drops to my toes.
  </p>
