  <h2>Leda</h2>
  <p>
    what if you knew me,
  </p>
  <p>
    and you discovered that
  </p>
  <p>
    after so long living
  </p>
  <p>
    in the exact same place as you,
  </p>
  <p>
    i didn’t know how to shower.
  </p>
  <p>
    that when i was in there
  </p>
  <p>
    i rubbed it cold from the tap
  </p>
  <p>
    in small circular motions with my finger-tips
  </p>
  <p>
    on my joints and temples
  </p>
  <p>
    because what else would i be
  </p>
  <p>
    doing in there with the water rushing?
  </p>
  <p>
    because my mother
  </p>
  <p>
    dead for two thousand years
  </p>
  <p>
    lying with dirt and cut gemstones
  </p>
  <p>
    between her ribs
  </p>
  <p>
    taught me never to go in the water
  </p>
  <p>
    where the fish live
  </p>
  <p>
    but to remove offending spirits with salt.
  </p>
  <p>
    you go from wet to dry so quickly
  </p>
  <p>
    don’t you know i have nightmares
  </p>
  <p>
    about falling in the lake?
  </p>
  <p>
    and i get stuck under a boat
  </p>
  <p>
    and everybody on the surface is laughing,
  </p>
  <p>
    and the boat has to be my friend now?
  </p>
  <p>
    don’t you ever worry
  </p>
  <p>
    while you’re in the shower,
  </p>
  <p>
    that you’ll never be dry in time?
  </p>
  <p>
    that this is it?
  </p>
  <p>
    this is how your skin has to feel forever?
  </p>
