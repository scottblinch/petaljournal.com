<div class="poem">
  <h2>The rain gives me headaches</h2>
  <p>
    like the drains in the street<br>
    have a connect line<br>
    into my head.
  </p>
  <p>
    I wake up and take two<br>
    extra strength Motrin,<br>
    their sugar coating<br>
    turning my tongue orange.
  </p>
  <p>
    a moth is flying around my room<br>
    banging into my dresser<br>
    and contemplating landing on me.
  </p>
  <p>
    it moves so quickly<br>
    that my eyes blur<br>
    trying to watch it<br>
    and I think that this moth is here<br>
    to remind me<br>
    of my lack of energy.
  </p>
  <p>
    I think of you<br>
    but you<br>
    do not think of me.
  </p>
  <p>
    I lie back down and wait<br>
    for my body to stop fighting me.
  </p>
