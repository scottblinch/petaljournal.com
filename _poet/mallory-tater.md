<div class="poem">
  <h2>Period</h2>
  <p>
    The winter my waist shed six inches,<br>
    my period stopped. My breasts depressed,<br>
    the skin around them slacked sackkish<br>
    and loose. I became like burlap and this calmed<br>
    my hands. I no longer had a belly to pinch.<br>
    My throat withstood the aftermath<br>
    of meals. I sucked lemons after losing<br>
    to cool and clean cuts from biled food<br>
    clawing. All this to say that when it stopped,<br>
    I was glad. Tampons at the bottom of my bag<br>
    became flattened but I kept them on hand<br>
    to hand to girlfriends in need before gym class.<br>
    I told my mother how sick I must be. She paid so much<br>
    attention to me we forgot my sisters, who held pencils<br>
    in their hands late into the night, who held hands<br>
    in church parking lots, laughing with communion<br>
    stuck to the roofs of their mouths. They did not take<br>
    the host from the priest, pretend<br>
    to swallow, slip it into their pockets. They wrote<br>
    nice letters to each other, slipped them under<br>
    bedroom doors, borrowed each otherâ€™s blouses<br>
    and blouses forever. They loved Sunday night<br>
    strawberries and ice cream in front of the tv.<br>
    They did not feed the dog their breakfasts.<br>
    Mabel would learn to love French toast, get fat<br>
    and sick and her paws would shake from old age<br>
    but I would imagine it as all the sugar I gave her<br>
    and feel a wave of shameful indulgence. I would<br>
    no longer bleed and cramp and share. I would say<br>
    I hoped to be clean and thin forever like this<br>
    but in secret, I felt unabashedly dry, abnormal<br>
    and light. For two years this continued.<br>
    For two years, I burned the woman<br>
    right from me, forgot all the women around me.
