<div class="poem">
  <h2>Place names surviving</h2>
  <p>
    There’s an acrobatic trick<br>
    you mastered then failed,
  </p>
  <p>
    throwing your body<br>
    off the pedestrian bridge<br>
    all pink welts and angles,<br>
    an obtuse splash.
  </p>
  <p>
    Staved off embarrassment<br>
    with a hoot as you surfaced,<br>
    tanned skin molten in the river algae.<br>
    Your eyes were on the cormorants.
  </p>
  <p>
    As you climbed, apologies,<br>
    your machinery chugging vertical,<br>
    I yawned all feline, cooed<br>
    and patted you dry.
  </p>
  <p>
    You didn’t test the air.<br>
    Stretch. Ask if it was<br>
    calling for thunder. Tell me<br>
    the coordinates of your flip.
  </p>
