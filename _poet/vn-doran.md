<div class="poem">
  <h2>Shovel</h2>
  <p>
    late and water higher than it was<br>
    fog thick as cobweb stars skittering<br>
    spiders running from the moon<br>
    silence except shovel sucking ground<br>
    tonguing deep and spitting
  </p>
  <p>
    who belongs to these?<br>
    some angel left her wings down here<br>
    never knew how to keep flowers alive<br>
    old cartilage cocooning under ribs a child<br>
    blooming and undone
  </p>
  <p>
    shovel hits stone<br>
    shovel hits end of the world<br>
    ruptures a nameless womb force feeds<br>
    a million meandering deaths<br>
    somehow the axis knows to shift tip filth<br>
    back in over loneliness
  </p>
