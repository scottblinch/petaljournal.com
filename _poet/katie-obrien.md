  <h2>Nighttime</h2>
  <p>
    here is a lonely penny in<br>
    the pocket of my leather coat<br>
    when the earth trembles I walk out<br>
    of my shoes continue barefoot
  </p>
  <p>
    sometimes I walk home alone<br>
    to convince myself I can make it<br>
    thirteen blocks without heading<br>
    into oncoming traffic<br>
    solitary electric bulbs in the<br>
    apartments above acting as stars<br>
    guiding me home
  </p>
  <p>
    there was function once<br>
    embedded in these tattered soles<br>
    when the earth trembles I walk out<br>
    of my shoes continue barefoot
  </p>
  <p>
    why does it feel as though I’ve<br>
    carved out my lungs and<br>
    served them to you on a platter<br>
    like a switch has been flicked,<br>
    a brick has been thrown,<br>
    every time that wry smile crosses<br>
    your scalpel lips
  </p>
  <p>
    if you opened my mouth<br>
    you’d see my heart on my tongue<br>
    when the earth trembles I walk out<br>
    of my shoes continue barefoot
  </p>
  <p>
    they call it the anniversary<br>
    effect a year later but<br>
    what about the day after<br>
    it’s the middle of the week and<br>
    his birthday was Wednesday<br>
    no candles to blow out<br>
    no candles to blow
  </p>
  <p>
    there is a lonely penny in<br>
    the pocket of my leather coat<br>
    when the earth trembles I walk out<br>
    of my shoes continue barefoot
  </p>
