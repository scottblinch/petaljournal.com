  <h2>The Future</h2>
  <p>
    I am going to quit talking about the future<br>
    at the end of the weekend or sooner.
  </p>
  <p>
    Maybe when we don’t feel<br>
    like piles of leaves
  </p>
  <p>
    or when we learn<br>
    to stop regarding snow only
  </p>
  <p>
    as frozen water waiting to melt.<br>
    I’m so over
  </p>
  <p>
    waiting for things to blow over,<br>
    be things they are not.
  </p>
  <p>
    Soon I’ll figure out something<br>
    worth knowing, how to be
  </p>
  <p>
    someone worth being. I’ll see<br>
    a fortune teller
  </p>
  <p>
    and she’ll have questions for me.<br>
    I’ll tell her something about the shadow of a tree,<br>
    how it is long but not unlimited.
  </p>
  <p>
    Light bends through branches and you<br>
    will lift up your shirt to show how the sun<br>
    traced the line of a northern oak on your chest.
  </p>
  <p>
    I imagine years passing until you<br>
    are not you, but details I know, like how
  </p>
  <p>
    you pinch your ear lobe when you are not<br>
    paying attention while resting
  </p>
  <p>
    your head in your hand<br>
    and how you will come and go,<br>
    like dusk, without asking.
  </p>
