<div class="poem">
  <h2>Acariasis</h2>
  <p>
    I knelt under a clear midnight sky and said<br>
    prayers to every celestial light.<br>
    I spilled the blood of plants over a fire<br>
    and looked for symbols in the smoke.<br>
    I turned my body into a lonely temple that needed<br>
    no alms to go on standing.<br>
    I moved like a shadow in secret rooms<br>
    trying to divine wisdom from ancient books.<br>
    I held the hand of more than one vigilant soul whispering<br>
    with voices only they could hear.<br>
    I walked a road glimmering into mirage with a thousand other sojourners,<br>
    looking for a place more sacred<br>
    than the one we had left.
  </p>
  <p>
    I spent countless devotional hours in love with the intricacies of human ritual.
  </p>
  <p>
    I never heard an otherworldly voice.<br>
    I never felt the cosmic ocean rise within me.<br>
    I thought of great spirits wanting endless attention and my resentment turned amyctic.<br>
    I saw beasts staggering and suffering toward death<br>
    and cursed whoever lacked the mercy to ease them.<br>
    I stood in hallowed places and felt myself among urticants,<br>
    feet chafed by holy grit.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a century of repetitions,<br>
    I learned a little of myself, and the sprawling earth.<br>
    But mostly I came to grasp<br>
    that I do not get along well with gods.
  </p>
