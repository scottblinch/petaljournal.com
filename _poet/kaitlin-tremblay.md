<div class="poem">
  <h2>Yellow Dress</h2>
  <p>
    Sometimes when I wear that dress,<br>
    the yellow one, with the lapels and<br>
    uneven hem, I think of<br>
    the way that man told you<br>
    (not me, of course), “Hey,<br>
    I can see up your lady’s dress.”<br>
    We were laying in the park.<br>
    You were angry for me – your anger<br>
    filled the vacuum left by my<br>
    complacency. How spared you were,<br>
    I think, to those kinds of comments.<br>
    There’s still a bit of a grass stain<br>
    on the bottom of that dress. A scratch<br>
    of green, cross-hatched, like a scrape.
