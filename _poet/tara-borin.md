<div class="poem">
  <h2>Going Back</h2>
  <p>
    Weeds grown tall<br>
    in our hard-won garden.<br>
    It didn’t take long for the bush<br>
    to take over:<br>
    it storms the clearing,<br>
    an army with endless recruits.
  </p>
  <p>
    Breath held<br>
    between timber walls,<br>
    woodsmoke and cabin ferment.
  </p>
  <p>
    Desiccated flies line windowsills,<br>
    squirrels have filled the tea cups<br>
    with spore-dusted mushrooms,<br>
    nested in torn cushions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Climb the ladder to the loft,<br>
    moth-bitten quilt still neat<br>
    on the mouse-burrowed mattress.
  </p>
  <p>
    The outdoors have moved in<br>
    among our forgotten things,<br>
    skirt our hushed spectres<br>
    going through their eternal paces.
  </p>
  <p>
    These logs echo our loving and<br>
    our leaving.<br>
    Winter without end,<br>
    sadness deep as the snow that year.
  </p>
  <p>
    Like a tree exploding in the quiet of forty below,<br>
    shotgun start,<br>
    we fled<br>
    not bothering to lock<br>
    the front door.
  </p>
