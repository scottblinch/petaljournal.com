<div class="poem">
  <h2>conjugation</h2>
  <p>
    <i>…j’attends des sons.</i><br>
    meteor showers mark<br>
    the languor
  </p>
  <p>
    with a 24-hour clock<br>
    for practice crossing the timeless<br>
    Atlantic—
  </p>
  <p>
    a wedge jammed<br>
    the static<br>
    portal, the wormhole squirrely
  </p>
  <p>
    as I recall<br>
    the sequence of past<br>
    events: there is a conjugation
  </p>
  <p>
    for every crazy<br>
    thing I’ve done—a certain<br>
    tense for the most gentle memory,
  </p>
  <p>
    an ending<br>
    accenting each reaction<br>
    and objection long
  </p>
  <p>
    forgotten—how clever.<br>
    as if by fire, <i>my own langue étrangère.</i><br>
    are we there yet?
  </p>
  <p>
    my love, it may take a lifetime<br>
    to sound…<br>
    less ridiculous.
  </p>
