<div class="poem">
  <h2>Blue</h2>
  <p>
    All I could think was,<br>
    I want someone to say that to me.<br>
    Blue is your colour.<br>
    As if to attribute oceanic<br>
    qualities to my being.<br>
    To accept the spectrum<br>
    of shades that make me<br>
    entirely desirable<br>
    and completely<br>
    loathed.
  </p>
