<div class="poem">
  <h2>Winter Light</h2>
  <p>
    A cold day<br>
    for a walk, you emerge out of the house<br>
    into clear, white air,<br>
    round and pregnant and<br>
    wearing a fuchsia sweater.<br>
    I think back to the years<br>
    we knew each other best
  </p>
  <p>
    and as we walk I listen<br>
    to your voice as out of a memory,<br>
    surreal over the soft crunching of ice<br>
    under our boots. You were gone for too long
  </p>
  <p>
    and now life’s taken you<br>
    in unplanned directions.<br>
    We walk side by side<br>
    and our breath is white against white.<br>
    The snow is powder,<br>
    light—the sun made all of flashes,<br>
    the shadows all of blue. I remember
  </p>
  <p>
    the summer photographs I took of you<br>
    against the sun: friendship was infinite then,<br>
    and you were mine, overexposed,<br>
    melting<br>
    almost into white.
  </p>
