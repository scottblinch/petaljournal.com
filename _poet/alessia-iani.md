<div class="poem">
  <h2>In the night</h2>
  <p>
    the lovers, hand in hand,<br>
    paint the night with toxins,<br>
    shed their hard shells,<br>
    grow soft again,<br>
    fall into the moist, wet earth<br>
    and try to feel,<br>
    dance-walk with anger<br>
    fast at their heels and<br>
    misunderstandings<br>
    settling like a shimmering dust<br>
    coating the roads as<br>
    they revel.<br>
    in the night their bodies play,<br>
    dark illuminating them,<br>
    forgetting the distant rooms<br>
    that ring with silence of<br>
    words unsaid,<br>
    stifled groans,<br>
    unfinished conversation,<br>
    ghost-tears shed in<br>
    early morning rage.<br>
  </p>
</div>
