  <h2>Inconnue</h2>
  <p>
    Do you still dream about an ice cold body stiff<br>
    as stone? The image like tiny pebbles<br>
    filled your throat. Your smile, silt<br>
    on the stem of a hooked crooked flower &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you remember<br>
    the year bitumen squirt out your green grass backyard–? Filled your kiddie pool<br>
    with toxic sludge.
  </p>
  <p>
    Obtrusive eyelashes, the still water<br>
    radiated in cross luminescent cat calls<br>
    in the picketed yards of our suburbia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we were never alone<br>
    And the sun…. it pierced through any half-assed movement or thought.<br>
    With indifference for time passing you were raw,<br>
    always sprawled out on some lawn chair.<br>
    That was how I knew you best.<br>
    Arms outstretched, empty palms turned<br>
    toward the sky.
  </p>
