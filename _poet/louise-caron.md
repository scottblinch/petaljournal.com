<div class="poem">
  <h2>Evanescent</h2>
  <p>
    Pearlescent is today’s word: made-up,<br>
    opal-sourced, white-budded.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thought white, now its progress to palest pink;<br>
    rows of teeth clamp on to succulence.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pearlescence is today’s word’s variant.<br>
    Tomorrow, pearlescence past,
  </p>
  <p>
    from hatched tusks, blood-stained ivory horns,<br>
    weird beasts will form.
  </p>
  <p>
    The plant imagines them.
  </p>
