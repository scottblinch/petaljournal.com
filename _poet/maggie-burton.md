  <h2>Margaret, the objects in this house</h2>
  <p>
    i. I am the saucer
  </p>
  <p>
    who watched for years during morning tea<br>
    as she scratched off the first few letters<br>
    of her morning Crossword<br>
    dirty words on the linen.
  </p>
  <p>
    She kept pennies scattered around the table<br>
    for this purpose, covered in blood,<br>
    flour, dish soap residue –<br>
    the fingerprints of everyone’s women –<br>
    heavy with gunk regardless of minting date<br>
    1963 Young Elizabeth with the bow in her hair or 2012 Old
  </p>
  <p>
    Queen. Her hand stirs the Carnation milk<br>
    eavesdropping on a perpetual<br>
    back and forth between the<br>
    spoon and the inside of the teacup.
  </p>
  <p>
    You hammered open this tin of milk years ago<br>
    after the can­opener flew out your one free<br>
    hand past his head<br>
    past your after­supper teas<br>
    out the open window<br>
    into the ocean he had just returned from<br>
    three months gone in summer<br>
    the one time you discussed the fresh<br>
    swell of your love child with him.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sugar ducks into the browned water<br>
    I wish I could see it touch the bottom<br>
    swimming, half visible<br>
    sheers flapping out the kitchen window.
  </p>
  <p>
    ii. I am the goat skin rug
  </p>
  <p>
    her fourth baby girl was born on<br>
    &nbsp; while she was kneading the Monday bread<br>
    she hardly had time to squat into position<br>
    dough caked between her fingers<br>
    stuck to her nails.
  </p>
  <p>
    I watched as she crowned too fast<br>
    fell out six weeks early<br>
    her unfused skull saved as she kissed my soft fur<br>
    blessing her forever with the omnivore’s enjoyment of life<br>
    of all its textures.
  </p>
  <p>
    Margaret hid me away before<br>
    her children were old enough to know the difference<br>
    between interesting origin prose<br>
    and a story of rural birthing gone awry.
  </p>
  <p>
    My soliloquy:<br>
    sodden with the after­birth<br>
    cut short and fast while the cord was still singing<br>
    by the clean hospital births of the rest of her brood.
  </p>
  <p>
    iii. I am the teaspoon
  </p>
  <p>
    that he glued to his wife while she was squeezing the last drop<br>
    of tea out of the bag one morning<br>
    so as not to waste it.
  </p>
  <p>
    He glued me to her hand<br>
    to fend off the temptations of her sex<br>
    after the last of her youngsters moved out.
  </p>
  <p>
    She lives in fear of ripping it off<br>
    her fingerprints coming off with the handle<br>
    how would they match her to herself when she is dead without them?
  </p>
  <p>
    iv. We hear the ghost
  </p>
  <p>
    He has been gone for some time now but not long enough to quit<br>
    dancing a love song at the foot of her bed while she pretends to sleep –
  </p>
  <p>
    a kinky party for two old lovers off smokes and whisky.<br>
    Sometimes we hear her say<br>
    you are just a ghost.
  </p>
  <p>
    No matter how many times she asks him to leave, please<br>
    the ghost still has to finish on her face first.
  </p>
  <p>
    Margaret, know that we do our best.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do our best as objects<br>
    in this house.
  </p>
  <p>
    v. Margaret scratches the Crossword (in perpetuity)
  </p>
  <p>
    D, G, now, and I’ll almost have a free one.<br>
    How hard is it to give me a bloody G you selfish lotto assholes.<br>
    I’ve given half my checks to you for nothing<br>
    more than a scatter free one.<br>
    Thank Jesus for the bonus letters –<br>
    W.<br>
    Shag this today.<br>
    They send all the winners to the mainland.
  </p>
