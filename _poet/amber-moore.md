  <h2>Amber Moore</h2>
  <p>
    The first time I heard the word ‘zen,’<br>
    my mother misused it.<br>
    “We’re going to be very zen today,” she assured,<br>
    “spontaneous.” This included nosing around at Goodwill,<br>
    the Salvation Army for worn copies of Stephen King or<br>
    old classics that we never read, but displayed, as if<br>
    they were poured over, talked about over brie melts and<br>
    amarone that someone decided should be<br>
    chilled.
  </p>
  <p>
    “The day is ours.”
