  <h2>WHEN I TOLD YOU</h2>
  <p>
    finally told someone &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in that idling car<br>
    in that empty parking lot &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the night<br>
    i laughed hysterically &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my chest heaved<br>
    i could not stop laughing &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; laughing and crying all at once<br>
    i never really realized &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that I never talked about it<br>
    my puckered stomach &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my frozen lungs<br>
    and that made me laugh &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and cry and laugh<br>
    you didn’t know what to do &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you just sort of sat there<br>
    looking dumbfounded &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at my heaving<br>
    at my pink flesh &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as it spoke something new
  </p>
