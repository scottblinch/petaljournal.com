<div class="poem">
  <h2>Archetype</h2>
  <p>
    Out of the corner of my eye, I see her.<br>
    She is a creature.<br>
    She has clung to my bedroom wall.<br>
    People sometimes have a<br>
    silent thought of her;<br>
    conjuring repulsion,<br>
    shudders of disgust,<br>
    stifled whimpers of fear<br>
    in spite of themselves.</p>
    <p>Hunting through the dark,<br>
    darting forward maybe backward<br>
    0.5 m/s,<br>
    the sudden bloom of lamplight<br>
    gives her pause.<br>
    Body like stemless wheat but somehow<br>
    impossibly limbed<br>
    <em>scutigera coleoptrata</em>.<br>
    She is now still as a criminal,<br>
    one that has broken and entered.<br>
    She gives me pause, too.</p>
    <p>Long after she disappears,<br>
    Trying to shake off the feeling that she<br>
    May still be close,<br>
    I drift away.<br>
    Heavy wool tucked around my body<br>
    Like armour.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>where are we? a lavatory, abandoned in the woods. we cover our heads in hoods fighting rain. we walk inside, unaware of the disrepair, barefoot in our bare feet 2 feet of black water, piss, blood and shredded paper. we climb the sloping concrete floor out of the filth in a desperate search for signals, suddenly trapped in a diseased room. we look to archetypes. we are lead to a colony on damp concrete of hundred-legged skeletons hung together in military formation lines, their antennae and extra limbs fuzzed vines and static impenetrable wires: skin-piercing scutigera bodies fencing us</em><br>
    <em>out.</em></p>
    <p>Waking up alone to a melted room.<br>
    It is unfair.<br>
    A small creature so bold and powerful,<br>
    she asks me mind-numbing questions that I cannot answer<br>
    (cannot, will not, stupid with sleep)<br>
    she grows, she is no longer in pause,<br>
    but I am frozen with dead-stress fear of success<br>
    she crawls in exponential growth<br>
    15 pairs of sticky feet<br>
    pulling down the plaster of<br>
    my bedroom walls.</p>
