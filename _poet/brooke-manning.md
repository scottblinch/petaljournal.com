<div class="poem">
  <p>
    To be silent and alone with you
  </p>
  <p>
    looking at and into
  </p>
  <p>
    long lapses in time when our voices may carry
  </p>
  <p>
    the quiet heaven of our individual
  </p>
  <p>
    depth
  </p>
  <p>
    We speak to the affect of ablating it
  </p>
  <p>
    We heal within its silence
  </p>
  <p>
    We sit quietly within the softened wash of night<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Transfixed beneath the motion of this night’s own
  </p>
  <p>
    evaporating shadow
  </p>
  <p>
    A quiet reminder
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we need never fear our very own
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p class="text-center">
    06/15, from of silence
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    If not for the rain
  </p>
  <p>
    it would be hard to imagine
  </p>
  <p>
    the fact of that
  </p>
  <p>
    stranger
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    If not for
  </p>
  <p>
    the curve in this
  </p>
  <p>
    road
  </p>
  <p>
    this
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    tongue
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; theirs
  </p>
  <p>
    a fork
  </p>
  <p>
    a gentle pressure of
  </p>
  <p>
    drops &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leaving
  </p>
  <p>
    pools
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    If not for
  </p>
  <p>
    the words we call
  </p>
  <p>
    thunder
  </p>
  <p>
    and
  </p>
  <p>
    motion
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    it would be hard to imagine
  </p>
  <p>
    this &nbsp;face
  </p>
  <p>
    once &nbsp;stranger
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  <p class="text-center">
    05/15, from of silence
