<div class="poem">
  <h2>Endlessly</h2>
  <p>
    starved myself again just to see if I could<br>
    felt the softness at the bottom of my belly
  </p>
  <p>
    contracting, becoming hard<br>
    is this what it’s like to have the upper hand?
  </p>
  <p>
    you appear like soft shadows<br>
    shapes in the corner of my eye
  </p>
  <p>
    I arch my back to meet you<br>
    my palms touch the cool wall
  </p>
  <p>
    on what used to be ‘your side’<br>
    I hate myself for buying in
  </p>
  <p>
    to monogamous love<br>
    monotonous sadness, I feel boring
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m bored of counting the days<br>
    realizing it’s winter soon
  </p>
  <p>
    my body feels skinny, empty<br>
    yesterday I counted my ribs
  </p>
  <p>
    how much time has to pass<br>
    for details to become memories
  </p>
  <p>
    how long is forever?<br>
    I know, I’m hard to love.
  </p>
